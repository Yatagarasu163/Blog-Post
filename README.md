This is a simple blog post website made as a capstone for Dr Angela Yu's Complete Web Development Bootcamp!

To run the website, you must first download `Node.js` from the official website.

Before running the website, run `npm i` to install all required Node dependencies.

You can change the port that the website runs on at `const port = 2000`.

Then, you can either download nodemon through `npm i -g nodemon` and run `nodemon index.js` in the terminal after pointing the terminal directory to the folder location, or run `node index.js` if you decided to not download nodemon.

After serving the website, you can then visit `https://localhost:2000` to view the website.
